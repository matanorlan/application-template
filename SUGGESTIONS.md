# Suggestions

### Project
Great to recieve your work at last. Good project structure. why only use bash ?
- Missing files of:
  - INSTALL.md
  - CONTRIBUTORS.md
  - TASKS.md
### README
Good detailed file.
- Missing link to
  - INSTALL.md
  - CONTRIBUTORS.md
  - TASKS.md

### INSTALL SCRIPT
- why not to write the whole script in python ?
- why not to add executtion permission as part of the saved file in repo (no need to require user to try hard)
- version number is incorrect, it needs to be 3 digit number with dot seperator: v1.2.3 for example
- too much use of echo command, structure single echo command, that print outs the usage message
- as mentioined too many times in class, do not use []. but use [[]]!!! seems like the code was generated by chatgpt
- list of packages are statically inserted in the script, while we talked in the class, to create more dynamic script by seperating list of packages in external files and install them by importing the values
